# AUTOMATIC_SUBTITLE_GENERATOR

🚀 Excited to share my latest project - an Automated Subtitle Generator using Streamlit and Deep Learning! 🎥

Have you ever wanted to add subtitles to your videos but found it time-consuming and tedious? I felt the same, so I created this solution that streamlines the entire process.

👉 Here's how it works:
1️⃣ Paste a YouTube video URL.

2️⃣ Click 'Play Your Video' to preview and download the video.

3️⃣ Click 'Generate Subtitles,' and the magic happens!

4️⃣ Our Deep Learning model transcribes the audio, syncs it with the video, and generates subtitles in real-time.

5️⃣ You get a fully subtitled video ready to share or use.

🔥 Features:
✨ Automatic audio extraction from the video.
✨ Real-time transcription and synchronization.
✨ Customizable subtitle styling.
✨ Efficient and user-friendly Streamlit interface.

I've shared a demo of the subtitled video in the link. Feel free to check it out and let me know what you think. 🤩

This project was a fantastic journey into the world of automation and AI, and I'm thrilled to share it with you all.
